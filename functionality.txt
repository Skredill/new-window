spawn random block

make block fall

make blocks rotate
    rotate object? seperate sprites for each rotation?

move block with arrow keys

array to keep track of what spaces are filled

    only update array when a new block spawns, to reduce lag

make blocks freeze in place when they hit the bottom, then spawn a new block

make blocks collide with eachother

clear lines when row is full
    blocks need to be seperate pieces so when a line is cleared it doesn't delete the whole block.
        maybe move whole block, but once block lands delete block and replace with individual cubes.



make blocks drop down when a row is cleared
